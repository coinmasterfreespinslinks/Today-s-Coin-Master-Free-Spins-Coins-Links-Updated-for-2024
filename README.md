### **How to Maximize Your Free Spins & Coins**

Once youâ€™ve claimed your free spins and coins, itâ€™s important to use them wisely to accelerate your progress in the game. Here are a few tips on how to maximize their potential:

1. **Raid and Attack**: Use your spins to raid other playersâ€™ villages for coins and attack their bases to steal their loot. Raids are especially beneficial because they allow you to collect multiple items at once, and attacking helps you earn coins while also defending your own village.

2. **Upgrade Your Villages**: Coins are essential for upgrading your villages. Donâ€™t waste them! Focus on upgrading your current village and unlocking the next one. This will also allow you to collect new cards, which are important for progressing in the game.

3. **Card Collection**: Collecting cards is a major part of Coin Master. Chests are a great way to collect cards, but youâ€™ll need coins to buy them. Use your coins to buy chests, and keep an eye on the card sets you are close to completing. Completing card sets will earn you rewards and progress you to the next stage of the game.

4. **Donâ€™t Forget About Pets**: Pets provide unique bonuses that can make your spins more valuable. Make sure to level up your pets and use them strategically during raids and attacks to maximize the rewards you receive from your spins.

5. **Timing is Key**: Try to play when special events are live, such as *Mega Raids* or *Card Collection Events*. These events typically offer better rewards for your spins, so youâ€™ll be able to collect more coins and cards in a shorter amount of time.
